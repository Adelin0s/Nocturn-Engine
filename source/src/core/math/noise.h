/** DOCS:
 * Rules:
 * Can you imagine what it’s like generating a chunk of these? Follow me:
Generate a Perlin noise (remember, you generate a two-dimensional array of values between 0 and 1), this noise will be used for the entire world (not really but just go with it for now). We’ll call it noise A.
Select a biome based on a new Perlin noise generated, (for example, below 0.5 is meadows and above 0.6 is mountains), let’s call it noise B.
Split A in chunks of 16×16, select the values for your current chunk
Split B in chunks of 16×16, select the values for your current chunk
For each of the values in A (horizontal and vertical, or X and Y) :
Find the altitude, using the previous formula (maximum x value + baseline), or your own
Determine the tile type based on the current biome of B, (if you are generating the tile x = 10, y = 15 of the noise A, you will read the type of biome from B from the tile x = 10, y = 15)
After the tile is filled with either grass, sand or whatever, we need to fill all the way down to Y = 0, using the following rules:
If Y = 0, we create bedrock
If Y < 6, there is a 70% chance of putting bedrock, and 30% of stone
If the distance to top tile is > 10, put stone, otherwise, put dirt.
